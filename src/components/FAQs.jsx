                        <h2>SECURITY QUERIES</h2>
                        <h3><i>Is it safe to send money using OROBO?</i></h3>
                        <p>Sending and receiving money through OROBO is extremely safe. We use SSL encrypted technology on all of our platforms to ensure your details and transactions are secure.</p>
                        <h3><i>How to identify a scam?</i></h3>
                        <p>To avoid scams, we recommend that you ONLY send money to one of our verified vendors or to friends and family members whom you trust. NEVER send money to unknown parties.</p>
                        <p>We ask that you report anything that seems fraudulent or suspicious to <a href="mailto:abuse@OROBO.com?Subject=Hello%20again">abuse@orobo.com</a>.</p>
                        <h3><i>Is it safe to send money online?</i></h3>
                        <p>Sending money online is far safer than carrying cash on your person. Although we offer agent pick-up services, this method is far riskier than online payment options and we recommend our alternative transfer options where possible.</p>
                        <h3><i>What form of identification is accepted?</i></h3>
                        <p>We accept up-to-date passports or a current driver’s license.</p>
                        <h3><i>What security measure do you have in place?</i></h3>
                        <p>OROBO has taken extra precautions to ensure your details and your money are safe and secure every step of the way.</p>
                        <p>In addition to being PCI DSS compliant, the most stringent level of security available in the payment industry, we are also certified by Trustwave.</p>
                        <h3><i>What happens if I send money and the receiver does not get it?</i></h3>
                        <p>If your receiver does not receive funds within two days, you may contact our support team at <a href="mailto:info@OROBO.com?Subject=Hello%20again">info@orobo.com</a>.</p>

                        <h2>PAYMENTS /PRICING QUERIES</h2>
                        <h3><i>How much does it cost?</i></h3>
                        <p>You can send money and pay bills at the low fixed fee of $4.99 per transaction. You can visit our homepage and enter the amount you would like to send and see what the receiver will actually receive.</p>
                        <h3><i>How much can I send?</i></h3>
                        <p>Any amount between $1 and $5000 can be sent. You are charged the same fixed transaction fee of $4.99 to send any amount within that range. That means, the more you send the more you save.</p>
                        <h3><i>What exchange rate do you use?</i></h3>
                        <p>OROBO uses AbokiFx to determine the exchange rate used. You can check the rates by visiting <a href="www.abokifx.com">www.abokifx.com</a>.</p>
                        <h3><i>How much will my bank charge me?</i></h3>
                        <p>We are not responsible for fees that may be imposed by financial institutions associated with your transaction. For example, some credit card issuers may treat the use of your credit card to use the Service as a "cash advance" and may impose additional fees and interest cost for the transaction. OROBO is not responsible for any cash advance fees, NSF fees, chargeback fees, or other, similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit card issuer, or other provider.</p>
                        <p>If you submit a transaction that results in us being charged NSF fees, chargeback fees, or other similar costs, you agree to reimburse OROBO for all such fees.</p>
                        <h3><i>What are the different payment receiving options?</i></h3>
                        <p>OROBO has five options available:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><u>Cash pickup</u>: Cash can be collected by the receiver at selected vendors.</li>
                            <li><u>Mobile money</u>: An eWallet that receivers can use to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone.</li>
                            <li><u>Airtime top-up</u>: The receiver’s mobile phone will receive prepaid top-ups.</li>
                            <li><u>ATM withdrawal</u>: The receiver will be able to withdraw the money from an ATM using a designated one-time code.</li>
                            <li><u>Bank transfers</u>: The receiver's bank account will be credited.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3><i>Can I change, cancel or get a refund for a payment?</i></h3>
                        <p><b>Money transfers</b> can be cancelled at any time prior to completion. Completion means that the money was sent to and received by the target banking institution, as directed by the Sender. The Transaction Amount will not be refunded after completion. All refunds will be credited to the same Payment Instrument used to pay for the Transaction. Refunds are only made in U.S. dollars and will not be adjusted to account for changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or foreign currency from the time your Transaction was submitted. </p>
                        <p>In the case of <b>Bill payments</b>, we allow a buyer protection window of 72 hours to cancel a transaction and be refunded. Once the biller has acknowledged the payment, a fulfillment window is set to allow the biller to fulfill (goods/services); this period is tentatively set to 10 days with an allowed extension of three days. After the fulfillment window, a customer can raise a dispute or confirm a fulfillment. If after seven days no dispute has been raised, the system assumes you are satisfied with the biller’s services and automatically settles the bill.</p>
                        <h3><i>Where are the cash pick-up locations?</i></h3>
                        <p>Where are the cash pick-up locations?</p>
                        <h3><i>Will my recipients be charged to receive the money I remit?</i></h3>
                        <p>Your recipients will receive the exact amount that is shown when entering the amount you want to send (which adjusts for the fee). </p>
                        <h3><i>Can you pick up money from OROBO without an ID?</i></h3>
                        <p>Identification is required if the recipients will be picking up cash, Gift cards or Vouchers at one of our agent locations.</p>
