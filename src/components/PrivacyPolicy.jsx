         <h2>OROBO's Privacy Policy</h2>
         <section className="context-section">
            <p>Saana Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation offering its online product known as <i>OROBO</i>, is serious about protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") covers how OROBO collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website and in conjunction with any of the services hosted at <a href="https://orobo.com">www.OROBO.com</a> ("Service" and "Website"), including bill payment and money transfer services accessed by internet enabled devices. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
            <p>The Policy was last updated on February 1, 2018.</p>
            <p>This Policy explains what personal information we collect about you, with whom we share it, and how you can elect in certain situations to not share information with third parties. "Personal Information" refers to information such as name and email that can be used to identify you individually.</p>
            <p>We may amend this Policy at any time, and whenever we do so we will notify you by posting a revised version on the Website. If, however, we plan to make a material change in the way we collect, use, or store your personal information, we will provide prior notice on our website, and by email. You will then have the chance to decide whether or not we will use or disclose your information in that new manner, whether via an "opt-out" procedure or by ending your relationship with us. Such changes will become effective, at the earliest, 30 days after the date of the email notifications.</p>
            <p>We ask that minors refrain from using our Service or submitting any personal information to us. Minors (those under the age of 18 years) are not eligible to use our Service.</p>
